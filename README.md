# mp3-music.com.bd
The script expects only 1 (one) argument, a full URL of an artist folder from music.com.bd, such as "http://www.music.com.bd/download/browse/A/Ark/".
Beyond it, the script traverses the anchors (a tags) in the site, looks for albums (so artists with no albums and 
direct mp3 links will probably not work. I didn't have enuf patience later to check this variance).

This scrapper is not meant to be misused to infringe copyright laws in Bangladesh. This is a piece of code I wrote to download bengali
songs from a site that already lets you download the mp3s for free, minus the effort to traverse and manage browser tabs;

Happy listening to Bengali, Bangladeshi songs from music.com.bd!

Cheers!
